This directory contains test cases for libjit, written in the
"Dynamic Pascal" language.  To add a new test case, perform the
following steps:

    1. Create the "foo.pas" file, containing the source code for the
       test case.  The test case should exit normally if it succeeds,
       or call "Terminate(1)" if it fails.

    2. Add "foo.pas" to the "TESTS" list in "Makefile.am".

    3. Re-run "auto_gen.sh" and "configure".

    4. Type "make check" in this directory to run all of the test cases.

Or you can run the test case manually with "../dpas/dpas foo.pas".
The test case is compiled and executed in a single step, in a similar
fashion to using a scripting language.

The following two options to "dpas" can help with debugging problems
in libjit:

    -d
        Dump the three-address form of each function as it is compiled.

    -D
        Dump the three-address and compiled forms of each function.

If you are unfamiliar with the syntax of Pascal, or merely a little rusty,
then the following EBNF grammar should help:

Dynamic Pascal is a subset of Standard Pascal, designed primarily for
testing libjit.  Patches are welcome to make it a more faithful Pascal
implementation.

Also see the file "dpas-builtin.c" for a list of builtin procedures and
functions that you can use in your test cases.
